# ytdcomments

Unfortunately, there is no option to bulk delete comments from your history. If you want to get rid of everything you've ever said on this platform, you will either need to continue doing this to each and every one of your comments or opt for a different approach and make some changes to your channel.

but with this extension, you can delete all your comments on youtube without having to bother with manual clicks one by one. this script will do it, you just press the start button and you can let the computer work for you.
